Add PNGs here to include them in the report:
  rosenbrock_samples.png   - scatter/contour plot for Rosenbrock (e.g. NUTS or GG-NUTS)
  funnel_samples.png       - scatter/contour plot for Neal's funnel

Export from the notebook (e.g. plt.savefig("report/figures/rosenbrock_samples.png")), then in report.tex uncomment the two \begin{figure}...\end{figure} blocks in the "Figures" paragraph and recompile.
